> War is hell, but war is also a brutal teacher.

These words from Jocko Willink strongly resonate with a recent dense work period. They triggered me to writing down some values that in my opinion are powerful agents in an async remote company. Now, you could say that these might be a good set for values not only for an async remote company, that it can be a set of personal rules as well and this might be true. I want to focus though on an angle given by an async remote work. Mapping it elsewhere is up to you.
