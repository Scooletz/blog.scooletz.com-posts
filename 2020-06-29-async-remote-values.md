> War is hell, but war is also a brutal teacher.

These words from Jocko Willink strongly resonate with a recent dense work period. They triggered me to writing down some values that in my opinion are powerful agents in an async remote company. Or maybe any company? You could say that these might be a set of personal rules as well and this might be true. I want to focus though on an angle given by an async remote work. Mapping it elsewhere is up to you.

## Clarity

The first and foremost is about speaking and writing in a clear way.

The other aspect, much more related to async-remote is over-communication which is so much important when we can't see the non-verbal cues and body language. Most of the time, one liners or single words won't do as they do not convey eye-rolling, hand waving etc, not to mention that short statements won't help to capture the context of the moment. Again, a reader might read your statement after a few hours. It might be even you, finding yourself in so much different emotional state, that the previous statement looks alien to you.

When communicating asynchronously adding a healthy doses of conditional statements might both, shorten the communication and show your point much clearer. Do not hesitate using `if`s and `else`s.

Do not fool yourself as you're the easiest to fool (who's line is it?). When discussing hard topics, do not dive into details nor provide a substitution.

Strive for clarify separating causes from effects. What about 2nd order effects, or 3rd?

## Yes/No

This might look like it's similar to the clarity. By using Yes/No I mean being definitive in your deeds. Is there a progress or not? Is it finished or not? How many times (this reminds me "bad stand ups") you heard or said

> I've been working

The Yes/No approach also requires some kind of assertiveness. You can't agree to everything. You should know is it feasible or not.

## Ownership

Extreme or not, ownership is probably the most painful thing if your organization lacks it. Owning something means getting things done. This also means that you should clearly define boundaries. Again, I'm not saying that you should push away things. I'd say quite contrary. You should strive to own.

One thing is to own, a separate thing is to observe the environment and map uncharted territories with no owners. This kind of awareness is vital, because it requires everyone to pay attention and to find owner if there's a lack of one.

Ownership doesn't mean that you can't drop the ball. This happens. It means that you don't roll a dice by saying that it'll be ok. It won't if you don't own things.

Owning things means that you sometime need to acquire a new skill. The thing requires new oil but you've never changed it? Learn it. There's more than 100 videos in the internet about it. Or buy some time by finding a specialist outside of the company and pay them with money instead of your time. Or use copy/paste on 10 rows instead of running a complex app to do it.

## Finishing things

One thing is to talk about finishing, not about doing, a separate one is actually solving issues. `In Progress` work is totally meaningless unless it's done. It might end with a failure, but without finishing it you can't say is it a failure or not.

The definition of DONE consists of a single DONE. DONE is not a steak. It cannot be medium rare. It's either done or not.

## Skin in the game

I think that it might be the hardest to expect from yourself. Maybe you're on a contract or you're employed in a company. Do you know how long can it last when a crisis comes? Do you know that can loose your contract/job if there's some financial problem in a company? Again, we might argue that you or me, that we're to important for a company to loose. This does not change my perception, that having skin in the game is vital for a healthy company. It might be hard to implement for everyone but its company responsibility to help people feel it. For instance, to make it more visible, in Dotnetos Ltd. I implemented the finance level as the number of months till the company financial death. You might not like the death reference, but it's true from the company point of view.

Skin in the game means also some kind of... an obsession? Imagine that another company is arguing to change a contract in a way that is really bad for your company. They say that it's because the management rules or something else. I'd say that having a pro-company skew, based on the skin in the game, should encourage you to question and ask about the approach of this other company. In other words external entities might have some impact and influence on your perception, but you should know where is your stand.

## Summary

Here they are:

1. Clarity
1. Yes/No
1. Ownership
1. Finishing things
1. Skin in the game

I'm aware that even with this stuff written down, I'll forget about these principles many times. I'll do my best to own the outcome.

What are your principles to create a good company/work environment? Have you written them down? Discussed? Thought about?
