There's a conflict between my values and the approach that Microsoft company was publicly presenting from the beginning of the putin's invasion on Ukraine. Microsoft provided no clear statement and only 2 days ago they published [Digital technology and the war in Ukraine](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/28/ukraine-russia-digital-war-cyberattacks). Their social profiles, including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/microsoft) mention bold statements like _inclusion_, _empowerment_, _innovation_ but it looks like it's not that fancy to condemn putin straight in the face. Finally I observe people of Microsoft raising this and discussing it in public. The company though, remains silent. At this moment I'm not interested in wearing the MVP badge provided by a company that cannot speak clearly and to the face in timing manner.

Now, probably you have a few questions, doubts or remarks. If you do, let me help you to clear them out.

### Why you talk only Microsoft

Why I don't push that hard on hundreds of other companies? So you can do it on your own. I've spent years in .NET ecosystem and Microsoft has provided the stack that I worked with for years. I had MVP title from them.

### Why lose impact

Do I lose the impact by saying that I'm not willing to be an MVP? I can still talk to people, I can still give presentations, I can still help in their development. The only thing that I no longer have is a title provided by the company that does not clearly speak up and condemn the attack.

### But Microsoft is doing a lot

It's more than sure that they do as well as Microsoft people. I'm missing this the clear statement provided to the face of the aggressor. You may want to  _you don't see the big picture_ me now. I might not see it.

### Dotnet Foundation got it right

It's interesting, because the [Dotnet Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) takes a stand and clearly says _We Stand with Ukraine_. It was a direct, clear and to the point, action taken in time. I like it.
