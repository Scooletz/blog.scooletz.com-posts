### TL;DR

This is the end of mini series related to Top Domain Model. Let's quickly go through all the topics we've covered.

### Top Domain Models

1. In [I'm temporal](http://blog.scooletz.com/2017/05/01/top-domain-model-im-temporal) we've covered one of the most underused techniques in modelling. Adding an explicit temporal dimension to the model.
1. Reading that [I've been pivoting all night long](http://blog.scooletz.com/2017/05/08/top-domain-model-ive-been-pivoting-all-night-long) brings a lot of different questions about aggregates and modelling them from different perspective, selecting the most useful.
1. In [behaviors, processes and reactions](http://blog.scooletz.com/2017/05/22/top-domain-model-behaviors-processes-and-reactions) we observed that aggregates on their own are meaningless. Why one would capture all the events if none of them caused a reaction?
1. The last chapter reminds to [not be so implicit](http://blog.scooletz.com/2017/05/29/top-domain-model-dont-be-so-implicit) and that capturing the same value twice or more sometimes is required to build a meaningful and useful model.

### Summary

I hope you enjoyed these loosely connected articles about modelling. As always, it's not about the most real models, but the most useful ones.
